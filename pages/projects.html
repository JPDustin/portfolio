                    <h3>Posters and Flyer Creation</h3>
                    <p>
                        In my journey to continually grow as a developer and designer, I decided to dive into the world
                        of scalable vector graphics (SVGs) using Inkscape. SVGs are an essential tool in modern web
                        design, providing crisp, scalable images that maintain their quality at any size, making them
                        ideal for responsive design.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Learning how to create and manipulate SVGs in Inkscape has opened up new creative possibilities
                        for me. Unlike raster images, SVGs are defined by XML code, which means they can be styled,
                        animated, and manipulated directly in code, offering a level of flexibility that’s hard to
                        achieve with other image formats.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With Inkscape, I’ve been able to design custom icons, logos, and illustrations that seamlessly
                        integrate into web projects, ensuring that the visuals are always sharp, regardless of the
                        screen resolution. This has not only enhanced the visual appeal of my projects but also improved
                        their performance by reducing the need for multiple image files.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The process of learning Inkscape has also deepened my understanding of vector graphics and their
                        role in digital design. I’ve become more proficient in using layers, paths, and transformations
                        to create complex designs, and I’m excited to continue exploring advanced features like SVG
                        filters and animations. As I continue on this path, I’m eager to see how I can further
                        incorporate SVGs into my work to create even more dynamic and engaging web experiences.

                    <h3>Mobile App Development</h3>
                    <p>
                        I currently drive for UPS, and like many of my colleagues, I keep track of my work hours on
                        paper. While this method is straightforward, it can become cumbersome when I need to go back
                        through the records to find specific details or quickly query data. This experience made me
                        realize how inefficient paper tracking can be, especially when accurate records are crucial for
                        ensuring fair compensation and adherence to our work contract.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Motivated by this challenge, I began developing a simplified tracking app tailored specifically
                        to our needs as UPS drivers. This app is designed to align with the unique aspects of our
                        contract, allowing us to easily track our hours worked, calculate specific metrics related to
                        overtime, bonuses, and other contractual obligations, and query our data whenever necessary.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The app aims to replace the manual, time-consuming process of paper tracking with a more
                        efficient, digital solution that not only simplifies record-keeping but also empowers drivers to
                        stay informed about their work hours and earnings. By creating a tool that meets our specific
                        needs, I hope to make the day-to-day operations smoother for myself and my fellow drivers,
                        providing us with greater control and insight into our work schedules and compensation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once I finish the iOS version of this app, I plan on developing the Android version to allow
                        everyone to have access to the app.

                    <h3>Cybersecurity</h3>
                    <p>
                        In November of 2023, I proudly completed the requirements for a Bachelor of Science degree in
                        Cybersecurity from Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU). Earning this degree was a
                        significant milestone in my journey, reflecting years of dedication and a deep interest in
                        protecting digital landscapes from the ever-growing threats that exist today.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since graduating, I've been diligently working to break into the field full-time. While the
                        journey has presented its challenges, such as intense competition and the high demands of the
                        industry, my passion for cybersecurity remains unwavering. The complexities and evolving nature
                        of this field only fuel my desire to contribute meaningfully to it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To stay sharp and continue growing, I regularly participate in cybersecurity-related challenges.
                        Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions and Hack The Box challenges have become a part of my
                        routine, allowing me to hone my skills in areas like penetration testing, network defense, and
                        cryptography. These activities not only keep me engaged with the latest trends and techniques in
                        the field but also provide a practical, hands-on way to apply what I’ve learned academically.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Additionally, I seek out personal growth opportunities, whether through advanced certifications
                        and
                        online courses. I’m committed to continuously improving
                        my skill set and staying ahead of the curve in a field where the landscape can change overnight.
                        My ultimate goal is to secure a position where I can leverage my skills and knowledge to protect
                        organizations from cyber threats, ensuring their data and systems remain secure.
